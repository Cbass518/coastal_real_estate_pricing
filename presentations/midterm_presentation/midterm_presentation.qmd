## Coastal Risks are Growing

<div id="left">

Climate-related risks:

- Sea level rise <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>
- Intensified storms <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>
- Erosion <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>

![](images/erosion_homes.jpg){ width=75% } <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>

</div>

<div id="left">

Non-climate risks:

- Insurance cancellation <a href="#ref4">[4]</a>
- Falling valuations <a href="#ref5">[5]</a>
- Decreased liquidity <a href="#ref5">[5]</a>

</div>

## But, Coastal Valuations Disagree!

<div id="left">

Higher risk and risk expectations do not perceivably sink prices.

- Ignoring risk <a href="#ref7">[7]</a>
- Dominating price movements:
    - Upscaling after destruction <a href="#ref7">[7]</a>
    - Inflation, housing shortage

## Relevance

Coastal counties in the U.S. account for:

- 40% of the population, <a href="#ref8">[8]</a>
- The majority of major cities & job centers,
- A large portion of the nation's real estate value,

and host much of the nation's most complex and important infrastructure.


## Coastal Real Estate Price Trends

According to a 2024 paper, despite the past, current, and foreseeable dramatic changes in climate risk factors, housing prices ... <a href="#ref7">[7]</a>

**Coastal property values are accelerating at a rate beyond non-coastal properties, even in the face of unproportionate risk growth.**

# Project Objectives 

## Project Objectives:

- Creating a novel, open-data process to independently evaluate conclusions from a [2024 paper on the coastal real estate price trends](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46548-6). <a href="#ref7">[7]</a>,
- Employing data science, GIS, and statistical skills to extract meaningful information from real estate data,
- Carefully planning and recording analysis procedures to practice academic report writing for a research project.


## Project Outcomes

- High-quality, comprehensive, georeferenced dataset of real estate transactions recorded by Zillow from 01/31/00 to 06/30/24, classified by coastal and non-coastal properties
  - Potentially useful for other analyses
  - Procedure for merging datasets to allow temporal updates
- Open the door for other questions:
  - Localization of coastal price trends
    - Historically weather-impacted vs. unharmed

# Pre-Analysis Plan

## Primary Project Data

**Zillow** (via [**NASDAQ Data Link**](https://data.nasdaq.com/))

Details:

- 5.5 GB of real estate transactions
- Categorized by *region_id*, a Zilow designation representing:
  - County,
  - Zip code, or
  - "Neighborhood"
- Varying categorization (some API-accessible only)

## Auxilliary Project Data

- Shapefiles:
  - US county, zip code shapefiles (2022+, Census Bureau)
  - Zillow neighborhoods shapefile (2017, EPA)

## Analysis --- Stage 1:

Assembly of coastal and non-coastal datasets:

![Screenshot of ArcGIS session: Selection of Coastal Counties](images/coastal_counties_example.png)

## Analysis --- Stage 2:

Development of:

- Randomized sampling scheme
  - Resulting dataset should be balanced
  - Validation of adequate spatiotemporal distribution
- Matching scheme for real estate to coastal, non-coastal sets

## Analysis --- Stage 3:

- Calculation of month-over-month average valuation changes for selected coastal/ non-coastal
- Paired t-tests to evaluate on a monthly basis:
  - $H_0$: The difference in the rate of change of home valuations between coastal and non-coastal communities is the same.
  - $H_1$: The difference in the rate of change is **not** the same.
- Multiple comparisons for months within calendar years, employing false-discovery rate control. 

## Limitations

- Testing procedure may be too conservative
- Mixed test results yields opaque interpretations
- Method is agnostic to cause of price trends
  - If risk *is* priced in, other market forces could still be dominating

## Possible Extensions and Enhancements

- K-means clustering to identify coastal communities with similar profiles
- Side-by-side time series spatial visualizations of price increases
- Revisitng analysis in the future

## Objectives for final presentation:

- Share findings, visualizations, difficulties encountered
- Report any procedural deviations from methods proposed here
